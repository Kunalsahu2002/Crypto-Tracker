## but i am making this project by watching a video lecture and copying same thing so things does not come from myself and i cant think myself that how to build this app for myself

It's completely normal to feel this way when you're learning by following a tutorial. Many developers start by copying code from tutorials to understand how things work. However, the key to truly learning is to move beyond copying and start thinking about how to build things yourself. Let me guide you on how you can transition from following tutorials to building projects independently.

1. **Understand the Purpose of the Project:**
What is this app doing?

It fetches cryptocurrency data from an API (CoinGecko).
It displays trending cryptocurrencies in a carousel.
It allows users to switch between currencies (USD and INR).
It has a homepage and a detailed page for each cryptocurrency.
Why is each component needed?

Header: Provides navigation and currency selection.
Banner: Displays the app's title and a carousel of trending coins.
Carousel: Fetches and displays trending cryptocurrencies.
CryptoContext: Manages global state (currency and symbol).
Coinpage: Displays detailed information about a specific cryptocurrency.
API: Provides functions to generate URLs for fetching data.


2. **Break Down the App into Steps:**
Instead of copying everything at once, try to build the app step by step. Here's how you can approach it:

● Step 1: Set Up the Project
Use Vite to create a React project.
Install necessary dependencies like react-router-dom, axios, and @mui/material.
● Step 2: Create the Basic Structure
Create a Header component with a title and a dropdown for currency selection.
Set up routing with react-router-dom to navigate between the homepage and the coin detail page.
● Step 3: Add Global State
Use React Context to manage global state for currency and symbol.
Make sure the Header component can update the currency.
● Step 4: Fetch and Display Data
Use axios to fetch data from the CoinGecko API.
Start with fetching and displaying trending coins in the Carousel component.
● Step 5: Add Styling
Use @mui/material for consistent styling.
Add custom CSS for additional styles.
● Step 6: Add the Coin Detail Page
Fetch and display detailed information about a specific cryptocurrency when the user navigates to /coins/:id.



3. **Experiment and Modify:**
Once you've built the app by following the tutorial, try to:
Change the API to fetch different data (e.g., top gainers or losers).
Add new features, like a search bar to find specific cryptocurrencies.
Customize the design to make it your own.


4. **Learn the Concepts Behind the Code:**
React Basics: Understand components, props, and state.
React Router: Learn how routing works and how to navigate between pages.
Context API: Understand how to manage global state.
API Integration: Learn how to fetch data using axios or fetch.



5. **Build a Similar Project on Your Own:**
After completing this project, challenge yourself to build a similar app without looking at the tutorial. For example:
A stock market tracker.
A weather app that fetches data from a weather API.
A movie database app using the TMDB API.


6. **Ask Questions:**
If you don't understand something, ask yourself:
Why is this component needed?
How does this function work?
What happens if I change this line of code?
Experiment with the code to see how it behaves. This will help you understand it better.


7. **Practice, Practice, Practice:**
The more you practice, the more confident you'll become. Start with small projects and gradually take on more complex ones.

# Final Thoughts---->
It's okay to start by copying code, but the goal is to understand it and eventually create your own projects. Take your time, and don't rush the learning process. You're already on the right path by building this project—keep going! Let me know if you need help with any specific part of the app.
